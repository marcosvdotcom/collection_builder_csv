sonia-lopez,Sonia Lopez,Sonora Mexico,San Diego State,,"My whole life was around my politics, my schoolwork and being a student was secondary.","Sonia Lopez was born in Sonora, Mexico. She immigrated at a young age to the United States, moving to Imperial Valley before settling in Calexico, a border town in California.",,"<p>Sonia Lopez was born in Sonora, Mexico. She immigrated at a young age to the United States, moving to Imperial Valley before settling in Calexico, a border town in California.</p>
<p>Lopez had a difficult childhood. Poverty controlled her life; her family didn’t have indoor plumbing, and in her interview, she struggles to hold back tears as she describes how it felt to come to school wearing other student’s hand-me-downs. Lopez’s father, an alcoholic, worked as a mechanic for farm machinery; her mother worked at local stores. With both parents out of the house, much of the housework and childcare fell on Lopez’s shoulders.</p>
<p>However, Lopez cites these difficulties as catalyst for change. In her interview, she says, “Living in poverty and knowing how much it hurts motivated me to say, I don’t want to be poor” (9:54). Because she wanted to escape poverty, Lopez worked hard to graduate from high school. Then, while most of her friends dreamed about getting married, Lopez set her sights on college. She attended community college before going to San Diego State through the Equal Opportunities Program in 1968.</p>
<p>It was in college that Lopez began to get involved with activism. College was a culture shock; she experienced stereotyping, and felt isolated and alone on campus. Joining MEChA completely changed her experience. She became, in her own words, a “political animal,” attending meetings all day, traveling across the state, and developing a Chicano Studies program. While involved with MEChA, Lopez became frustrated with the strict gender roles within the organization. Women were tasked with traditionally female jobs, like answering phones and cooking for the male members, all while being subjected to men’s predatory advances. While being a “feminist” had negative connotations, Lopez and her friends began to fight against these traditional gender roles; as Lopez says, “We were becoming feminists but not saying that we were becoming feminists” (2:37).</p>
<p>Lopez’s political involvement opened doors, but it also limited her ability to be a student. In 1970, she left San Diego State, putting schoolwork secondary to politics, and traveled around the country advocating for Chicana/o rights with figures like Corky Gonzalez, Reyes Lopez Tijerina, both of whom she openly challenged about sexist remarks. She later went to Sacramento to finish her coursework. When she finished school, Lopez returned to Calexico to help with a brother who was struggling with addiction, and remained in Calexico for several years, working as a counselor in the high school and as a campaign manager for a friend in 1975.</p>
<p>Lopez went on to teach as a professor, first at San Diego State, and then at Fullerton State. She also attended law school. Through studying law, Lopez became passionate about immigration reform, and began to work with undocumented youth. She remains active in Chicana/o rights, and acknowledges the positive social change she and other women have created. Lopez wants her experiences to help tell the story of many women who, forgotten by history, made a real difference in the Chicana/o movement.&nbsp;</p>",mujeres,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/sonialopez.jpg,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/sonialopez.jpg,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/square_thumbnail/public/sonialopez.jpg,https://chicanapormiraza.org/chicanas/sonia-lopez
rita-sanchez,Rita Sanchez,"May 20, 1937 in San Bernardino, California",Stanford University,,"In order to complete my Ph.d at UCSD and get tenure at SDSU, I had three full time jobs: full time mother; full time grad student; and full time professor.","Rita Sanchez was born and brought up in San Bernardino, California, seventh of eleven children. Her parents and their parents were from New Mexico, which had been home to her family for generations. Her ancestors were, in her words, the “first mestizos,” because of intermarriage between Spanish and Indian. This history, Sanchez points out, was the beginning of her “Chicana coming-to-consciousness,” the pride in her heritage, a tradition that she has celebrated throughout her life.",,"<p>Rita Sanchez was born and brought up in San Bernardino, California, seventh of eleven children. Her parents and their parents were from New Mexico, which had been home to her family for generations. Her ancestors were, in her words, the “first mestizos,” because of intermarriage between Spanish and Indian. This history, Sanchez points out, was the beginning of her “Chicana coming-to-consciousness,” the pride in her heritage, a tradition that she has celebrated throughout her life.</p>
<p>In her interview, she also takes pride in the way her parents raised eleven children. Sanchez grew up in a working class family. She recalls that she and her siblings did not wear shoes during the summer so that they wouldn’t wear them out for school. To her, those summers were about family: playing outdoors in fields that surrounded their home; stacking bales of hay into play houses with her brother and sisters; and watching her dad and brothers care for horses he raised. “I also remember my father and five brothers planting fields of crops, corn on one side and boysenberries on the other, she said. “We didn’t have much money but we did not consider ourselves poor. My mother and father always put food on the table.” In the realm of education, however, she noticed the discrepancies. For example, her high school counselor told her not to think about college, and encouraged her to take secretarial courses instead. She advised, “Don’t plan on going to college. Your parents can’t afford it.” Luckily, not everyone in Sanchez’s life gave such pessimistic advice.</p>
<p>In 1956, Sanchez was editor of the high school weekly newspaper, and her journalism teacher paid special attention to her because of her writing abilities. He encouraged her to apply for college. He also helped her apply for and win a financial scholarship, a competitive journalism award given by the local newspaper. She won first place.</p>
<p>Besides her teacher’s encouragement, Sanchez credits her five sisters, especially three older ones for her applying to college. She was not the first. In 1953, her sister Mary was a California Girl’s State leader who got to travel to Sacramento to attend a high school conference. At the local college, she was editor of the yearbook. However, Rita was the first one to go away and her father was especially resistant to her decision. In 1956, with the help of her sisters, however, she convinced her father to allow her to enroll at San Jose State University to study journalism.</p>
<p>Freshman year was not automatically easy for Sanchez. Although she enjoyed her courses, she was alone most of the time, living with an Anglo family in a room away from campus with no guests allowed. A boy in her school saw her, invited her out; they fell in love and married the next year, against her family’s advice. “My mother reminded me that I was raised Catholic and he was not.” Much to her father’s disapproval, she dropped out so that she could work full time in order to finance her husband’s education, including law school, and a move to San Francisco. Living in a flat in a strange city, while her husband attended law school, worked, and studied nights, she missed her large family. “I thought I was being the altruistic woman I was expected to be; but besides that, I thought I knew it all, and so did not stop to listen to my family.” She also had two daughters, with all of the joy that came with them, but then came the pangs of isolation, raising them alone much of the time. As a working mother, and with plenty of guilt, Sanchez decided to return to school, one course at a time. Despite her sacrifices, her husband, now an attorney, questioned her choices, especially when it interfered with household duties; when she protested his judgments—challenging gender roles, and his long hours of absence from the home—their marriage ended. After ten years of marriage, they divorced.</p>
<p>In 1969, Sanchez got custody of their daughters and, broken hearted, went back to school. According to her interview, she “walked right into the Chicano/a movement.” As she became more involved in a community of people dialoguing about their civil rights, she became engaged in political activism. “I began to care about other people, rather than feeling sorry for myself; besides, they felt like family to me. I also began to understand the double standards I had faced, as well as my own immaturity.”</p>
<p>As a young mother, she realized she had been trying to understand these conditions on her own. She also met people who believed in her abilities. She worked hard to get good grades, transferred to Stanford University, changed her degree from journalism to English, so she could teach, and joined Chicano student groups on campus. Professor Arturo Islas, her advisor, invited her to join a campus committee called “Assistant to the President for Chicano Affairs.” This advisory to the president of the university was the result of hundreds of African Americans and Mexican Americans entering college for the first time since the Civil Rights Act of 1964. We were also the committee that hired Cecilia Burciaga, assistant to the president. Working on the committee led to a whole new perspective that changed the course of her life. In 1973, she applied for the Chicano Fellows Award, given as a result of a proposed academic project. The first woman, Sanchez proposed teaching a writing course to incoming Chicano students arriving at the university for the first time; and a course for women she called “Mujer de la Raza,” a title after Antonia Castaneda’s Chicana course at the University of Washington in the 1960s. Sanchez edited for publication the student writings from the women’s course she taught that year.</p>
<p>At Stanford she received two Masters degrees. She got a Master’s in Education; and, soon after, a Master’s in English Literature. In 1974, she was hired at San Diego State to teach English, the first tenure-track woman in the department of Chicana and Chicano Studies. In order to be tenured she had to be in a Ph.D program. She was accepted at UCSD with a Ford Foundation Fellowship–now incredibly busy, but passionate about all aspects of her life. In 1976, she still had a drive to organize a Chicana course, and to act as editor of a Chicana journal, Vision, upholding the idea that “writing is a revolutionary act,” from a talk she gave as one of a few Chicanas at a Latin American Women Writers Conference at San Jose State in 1976. She also recalls another time she presented at the UC Berkeley First Annual Chicana Conference with two others, one of whom was Anna NietoGomez. In 1977, she met her second husband, Mario Torero, an artist, and had two more children. She was, in her own words, a “full-time mother, a full-time teacher, and a full-time student.”</p>
<p>In 1983, when she was given a terminal year at SDSU because she had not completed her Ph.d. she instead became more entrenched in the arts and political communities. Together, Sanchez and Torero opened up the Acevedo gallery, where she worked for eight years and where Sanchez successfully sold Chicano art. After twelve years of marriage, they went their separate ways and Sanchez returned to teaching.</p>
<p>In 1990, Sanchez was hired in a joint position with the English department and the department of Chicana/Chicano Studies at Mesa College, the first full-time Chicana professor to be hired since the department began in 1970s. She moderated a Chicana Literary Symposium designed by her colleagues who had hired her. It included Ana Castillo, Lucha Corpi, and Alma Luz Villanueva. Sanchez eventually became the first Chicana to chair the department; she has been responsible herself for bringing such dignitaries to campus as Dolores Huerta, Gracia Molina de Pick; and giving a special homage to Elizabeth ‘Betita’ Martinez. She has given several presentations inviting her colleagues to join her. One of them for Womens History Month was “Writing Maria Amparo Ruiz de Burton Into American Literature,” a contemporary of the greats, Helen Hunt Jackson and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Sanchez published other works, including “The Five Sanchez Brothers,” Mexican Americans &amp; World War II, (Ed. Maggie Rivas-Rodriguez. Austin: UTexas Press, 2005). However, she will always be best known for her 1976 “Writing as a Revolutionary Act” essay, republished as “Chicana Writer Breaking Out of Silence,” in Chicana Feminist Thought: The Basic Historical Writings (Ed. Alma M. Garcia. New York: 1997).</p>
<p>Rita Sanchez, Professor Emerita, is happily remarried and lives in San Diego with her husband of twenty years, Richard Griswold del Castillo; they have six children between them and nine grandchildren. Sanchez continues to write and make art as a way to create positive social change. Presently she is gathering the stories of local Chicanas. In 2011, surrounded by her family and children, she was inducted into the San Diego Women’s Hall of Fame in the area of “Activist.”</p>",mujeres,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/ritasanchez.jpg,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/ritasanchez.jpg,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/square_thumbnail/public/ritasanchez.jpg,https://chicanapormiraza.org/chicanas/rita-sanchez
olivia-puentes-reynolds,Olivia Puentes Reynolds,,"Mesa Community College, San Diego State University",,"I was making the declaration about not just being a Mexican American. I was a Chicana. It had nothing to do with what other people said, it is my declaration and it came from me.","Olivia Puentes Reynolds sits for her interview with a guitar on her knee. Hers is a story of music and mythology, her activism inspired by poetry. Reynolds’ archive of health reports and radical newsletters is peppered with songs and drawings, complete with an entire <em>teatro frontera </em>booklet. Throughout her life, Reynolds combined art, music, and writing to stand up for social change.",,"<p>Olivia Puentes Reynolds sits for her interview with a guitar on her knee. Hers is a story of music and mythology, her activism inspired by poetry. Reynolds’ archive of health reports and radical newsletters is peppered with songs and drawings, complete with an entire <em>teatro frontera </em>booklet. Throughout her life, Reynolds combined art, music, and writing to stand up for social change.</p>
<p>Olivia Puentes Reynolds was born to a mixed-race family – her mother Chicana, her father Irish, English, and Cherokee. While she speaks about loving her mixed-race heritage, Reynolds says she always identified as Chicana, even though she grew up speaking English as her first language. Reynolds did not have an easy childhood; she mentions experiencing domestic abuse, as well as discrimination for being a person of color. She found comfort in music, learning to play guitar at the age of 18 and continuing to play music for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>Reynolds started her journey with higher education at Mesa Community College. She discusses struggling at community college because she was surrounded by wealthy, white students with whom she struggled to identify. At community college, Reynolds became involved with Mexican-American student organizations. She then transferred, through the Equal Opportunities Program, to San Diego State. Reynolds is honest about her struggle with identity while at college. She discusses how she didn’t want to identify as “Mexican,” even though she found Mexican-American student organizations to be a great source of support. To her, “Mexican” was a dirty word. She had to confront her own internalized oppression and feeling ugly to come into self-love and believing that brown is beautiful.</p>
<p>While at college, Reynolds began noticing oppression based on both her race and gender. She describes her “click” moment of realizing gender inequality as being in a Chicano student meeting. She voiced an idea, and no one took it seriously; when a male colleague repeated the same idea, everyone responded well. Reynolds describes the frustration surrounding these types of encounters, though she also notes how “dangerous” it was to call oneself a feminist; not only did people take you less seriously, she says, but also men weren’t attracted to feminists. Reynolds doesn’t seem to mind these negative connotations; she says she is “done with Chicano men forever” because of their macho attitudes.</p>
<p>A pinnacle moment for Olivia Puentes Reynolds’ activism was when she read her poem, “I heard black is beautiful,” aloud at the Denver youth conference in 1969. Reynolds was 19 years old, very pregnant, and desperately nervous, but she got onstage and read her poem because, as she says, she was used to the unfair treatment of women and wanted to stand up for women as contributors to the Chicano movement. The poem is about wanting to feel beautiful as a brown woman in a world where attention is most often given to white voices. She received a standing ovation from the audience.</p>
<p>Reynolds continues to be active in advocating for women’s rights. Her work now is focused on sexual assault and rape. &nbsp;</p>

She graduated in 1980 with a degree in Criminal Justice and a major in Chicano Boricua Studies. Her motivation to graduate partially stemmed from her grandfather, who attended her graduation wearing full revolutionary regalia, shouting, “Viva Herrada!”</p>
<p>Several of Elena Herrada’s archival documents include references to Gilbert Gutierrez, Herrada’s old boyfriend. Gutierrez was killed in 1977, and Herrada participated in his trial. Herrada cites Gutierrez as the reason she studied Criminal Justice in college.</p>
<p>Much of Herrada’s later activism stemmed from the concept of “Los Repatriados,” the Repatriated. The Repatriated refers to the history of Mexican immigrants who were encouraged to move to the U.S. to work in bracero programs, only to be deported in massive numbers during the Depression, serving as a scapegoat for U.S. economic issues. Many Mexicans and their U.S.-born children moved back to Mexico, often to lead impoverished lives. Herrada’s family experienced this history, being forced to move to Mexico in 1930, and then returning to Detroit in 1932. Herrada’s research and activism surrounds raising awareness of this history through screening documentaries, collecting oral histories, and hosting events to raise awareness about Los Repatriados.</p>

As part of a long history of neglect by the city, her neighborhood had a severe lack of books and literature, and Carmen was extremely eager to get her hands on anything and everything that she could read.</p>
<p>In her senior year of high school and first years of college at Texas Lutheran, the Chicano Movement opened Carmen’s eyes to the beauty and cultural significance of her Mexican American culture as she experienced Chicano art, poetry, literature and self-empowerment for the first time. After two years at Texas Lutheran, Carmen transferred to Austin College and completed her Bachelor’s of Arts in Education in Spanish and French and her Master’s of Arts in Education in just four years. The same year, 1973, Carmen became the director of the Mexican American Studies center at Texas Lutheran College. She was just 22 years old and worked diligently to determine what a Mexican American Studies center should be and how she could help the few Mexican American students who were enrolled at the college. It was here that she faced further discrimination due to her ethnicity, gender, and youth as a college professor.</p>
<p>Almost by accident, Carmen first publicly read her poetry in 1975 at the Festival de Flor y Canto 2 in Austin, Texas, and after a positive review, the writing world was opened to her in 1975. In 1977, she participated in the production of “Sonrisas” a bilingual television program for Mexican American children. She had her first tenure track position at California State, Fresno and received her PhD in 1982 in bilingual education at the University of Texas at Austin, using “Sonrisas” as material for her thesis project. Carmen was one of the groundbreaking professors who introduced multicultural considerations into Women’s Studies departments in the mid-1980s. In 1999, Carmen received the Art of Peace Award from St. Mary’s University for her production of works that contribute to peace, justice, and human understanding. Carmen was named the first Poet Laureate of the City of San Antonio in 2012 and became the State Poet Laureate of Texas in 2015 after recovering from breast cancer in 2013.</p>
<p>In the past several decades, Carmen has published five books of poetry, eight illustrated children’s books, seven television screenplays, one non-fiction volume, and one collection of short stories.

Born in May 8th, 1948, she was the only daughter to Jose Guadiana and Maria Guadiana who had four boys before Guadiana was born. Guadiana cites her father’s organizing with cultural and civic organizations in Detroit and the fact that she grew up in a household with only male siblings as a major influence on her self-identity as an independent and culturally driven individual, regardless of her gender.</p>
<p>Guadiana graduated from high school in 1966, and it was not too long after that she started becoming conscious of social justice issues and social movements. The 1960’s were a time of growing awareness for Guadiana because of figures such as Cesar Chavez and Martin Luther King Jr. who was assassinated in 1968. Her involvement with the 1968 presidential campaign of Eugene McCarthy (who was against the US involvment in Vietman) really opened the doors to her future involvement with the Chicano movement.</p>
<p>As a result of her connections with Thomas Gonzales and his involvement with the Catholic Workers movement, she attended her first rally for the grape boycott in Detroit, Michigan. She attended the 1969 Brown Barets Convention in Los Angeles, California,&nbsp;with the Detroit Chapter of the Brown Berets, which she had helped organize. Then in&nbsp;1970, she attended the Chicano Youth Conference in Denver, Colorado. As a Chicana from the Midwest, she had always felt as though both herself and her Midwestern peers were considered outcasts in comparison to the organizers in the southwest United States.</p>
<p>In 1972, Guadiana was in the first cohort of <em>Latino en Marcha</em>, which was an initiative to increase the college attendance of the Latino community in Detroit. Not long after, she was hired as one of the community organizers focusing on Latina/o education issues in Detroit. This project did not pan out, so Guadiana worked many clerical jobs for companies around Detroit, which pushed her to go back to school. With her great background in community activism, she was admitted into the Wayne State School of Social Work and earned her MSW in 1978.</p>
<p>In Detroit, Guadiana became the director of the senior citizens program at LA SED (Latin Americans for Social and Economic Development). She later forged a career in geriatric social work that took her to various communities around Michigan, but eventually, she found herself working with high school populations in Battle Creek, Michigan. Once she saw that there was an opening at the Cesar Chavez Academy High School in Detroit, she returned to her native city and has been working on behalf of students there ever since.</p>",mujeres,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/maria.png,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/maria.png,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/square_thumbnail/public/maria.png,https://chicanapormiraza.org/chicanas/maria-anita-guadiana

She also recounts growing up in a home where power dynamics between her mother and father were more pragmatic and egalitarian. It was these early insights and environments that would propel NietoGomez into a powerful journey of activism and revolutionary scholarly work.</p>
<p>The daughter of a World War II veteran and a railroad clerk, NietoGomez began her career in higher education at San Bernadino Community College but she soon matriculated into California State University at Long Beach. While at Long Beach, NietoGomez began to formalize her activism through student organizing in M.E.Ch.A. and UMAS, publishing collectives, one which lead to the newspaper <em>Las Hijas de Cuauhtemoc</em>, counseling through the EOP office at Cal-State Long Beach and other informal mentoring capacities.</p>
<p>Approaching the turn of the decade in the late 1960’s, NietoGomez eventually began working as an assistant professor in Chicano Studies at Cal-State Northridge (CSUN). NietoGomez pioneered and gave rise to what is arguably the first critical&nbsp;<em>Chicana</em>&nbsp;Studies curriculum. Through her personal research and community organizing experiences, NietoGomez singlehandedly wrote the curriculum for four classes on the Chicana with topics ranging from history, contemporary social issues, global identity, and the family. Nevertheless, in a tenure dispute that escalated into a national call for action in solidarity with Chicana women in higher education, NietoGomez resigned from Northridge in the fall of 1976. The case of NietoGomez’s professorship and tenure demonstrates the pitfalls of the white male dominated Ivory Tower and of machista Chicano ideology, both institutions challenged by NietoGomez and her supporters—students, professors, and Chicanas and Chicanos alike from across the country—who believed she was a victim of racism, sexism, and academic elitism.</p>
<p>NietoGomez is a true activist/scholar who often bridged the&nbsp;<em>barrio</em>&nbsp;with academia directly. Her commitment to the cause of social justice is nourished by her capacity to endure and remain steadfast in the ideals she crafted over her expansive career as a writer and editor. Beyond her groundbreaking essay and journal&nbsp;<em>La Femenista&nbsp;</em>and <em>Encuentro Feminil,&nbsp;</em>NietoGomez has been producing and researching in the areas of sexuality, reproductive rights, workers rights, welfare rights, higher education, and policy up until the present day.</p>",mujeres,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/nietogomez%20still.png,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/nietogomez%20still.png,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/square_thumbnail/public/nietogomez%20still.png,https://chicanapormiraza.org/chicanas/anna-nieto-gomez

Cotera describes her upbringing as having a strong dose of progressive politics as a result of her grandparents’ interest in Mexican politics. In 1946, Cotera and her mother immigrated to El Paso, Texas. Cotera was reluctant to move and encountered racist policies in both elementary school and high school while in Texas. Despite these challenges, she describes herself as a “total overachiever” in high school as she was a member of the Writing club, English club, and editor of the school newspaper.",,"<p>Martha Cotera was born in Chihuahua, Mexico in 1938. Cotera describes her upbringing as having a strong dose of progressive politics as a result of her grandparents’ interest in Mexican politics. In 1946, Cotera and her mother immigrated to El Paso, Texas. Cotera was reluctant to move and encountered racist policies in both elementary school and high school while in Texas. Despite these challenges, she describes herself as a “total overachiever” in high school as she was a member of the Writing club, English club, and editor of the school newspaper. Cotera earned her Bachelor of Arts in English with a minor in History at the University of Texas at El Paso in 1962, the same year she became a United States citizen. Cotera cites this period as marking her awakening as a political activist.</p>
<p>In 1963, Cotera married fellow student, Juan Cotera, and they moved to Austin, Texas so that her husband could continue his education in Architecture at the University of Texas. Although Cotera and her husband encountered extreme racism in Austin, they were determined to stay and help transform the city. In 1964, Cotera was hired as Director of Documents at the Texas State Library in Austin. Later in 1968, she became the director of Southwest Educational Development and was put in charge of 28 libraries across the state of Texas. During this time, both Cotera and her husband were involved in several political and activist organizations including PASSO (Political Association of Spanish Speaking Organizations), and the farmworkers movement. In 1964, Cotera and other educators formed TEAMS (Texans for Educational Advancement for Mexican Americans), a group of educators who garnered support for high school students who participated in student boycotts organized by the Mexican American Youth Organization. In 1968, Cotera and her husband volunteered intermittently in Crystal City, Texas providing curriculum materials and tutoring students who were boycotting the high schools. In 1969, Cotera and her family chose to leave Austin and briefly moved to Mercedes, Texas where she and her husband helped found Jacinto Trevino College. Supported by Antioch College and its University Without Walls program, Jacinto Trevino College was developed as a college for Mexican Americans to prepare teachers for bilingual bicultural education programs. Cotera earned a Master's Degree in Education from Antioch College in 1971.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Crystal City, Cotera headed the Crystal City Memorial Library and was responsible for democratizing the library system. Both Cotera and her husband were intimately involved in the founding and structuring of the Raza Unida Party, a third political party centered on Chicano nationalism. In 1972 Cotera ran for a seat on the State Board of Education on the Raza Unida Party ticket and was instrumental in bringing women into the party. Eventually, Cotera and other women active in the Raza Unida Party began to feel marginalized by the male leadership of the movement, so they established Mujeres de La Raza Unida, a women’s caucus within the party that advocated for the recruitment of women as members. Cotera, along with other women in the Mujeres de La Raza Unida Party, established a Chicana Caucus within the Texas Women’s Political Caucus that drafted several resolutions for the TWPC to consider. In 1974, Cotera (along with Evey Chapa) founded the Chicana Research and Learning Center in Austin, Texas which helped find grant money for research and community projects with an emphasis on women of color. Cotera eventually founded Information Systems Development, an independent research and publishing company which focused on publishing resource materials on and about Chicanos and Chicanas. Cotera self-published her first book in 1976 entitled <em>Diosa y Hembra. Diosa y Hembra </em>was a contribution to the recovery of lost, erased, and hidden histories of Chicana women that&nbsp;generated a tidal wave of interest among Chicana students and within the women’s movement. Cotera then published <em>The Chicana Feminist </em>in 1977, which was a series of essays and speeches reflecting on Cotera’s experiences and observations of the dynamics of feminism within the Chicano/a Movement and of racism and classism within the women’s movement. Since publishing these pivotal works, Cotera has published several more works about Chicanas in politics and the history of Chicanos.</p>
<p>Cotera worked for nearly three decades as a community liaison for the Benson Latin American Collection at the University of Texas until the position was eliminated due to budget cuts and shifting priorities. She&nbsp;is currently an independent translator and community consultant, and remains active in local politics and community initiatives including the Mexican American Cultural Center, immigrant rights, and Code Pink. She has also been a strong and eloquent advocate against the death penalty in Texas.</p>",mujeres,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/MartaCotera.png,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/MartaCotera.png,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/square_thumbnail/public/MartaCotera.png,https://chicanapormiraza.org/chicanas/martha-cotera
barbara-carrasco,Barbara Carrasco,"1955 in El Paso, TX",,"Board of Directors, Dolores Huerta Foundation","I learned at that early age that the word 'no,' or rejection, you can really turn it around if you're determined to get some place.","Barbara Carrasco holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts in art from the University of California, Los Angeles and a Master’s of Fine Arts from the California Institute of the Arts. She has been a muralist and artist in various media since her childhood.",,"<p>Barbara Carrasco holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts in art from the University of California, Los Angeles and a Master’s of Fine Arts from the California Institute of the Arts. She has been a muralist and artist in various media since her childhood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carrasco was born in 1955 in El Paso, Texas, but her family moved to the housing projects for veterans in Culver City (near Los Angeles) within a year of her birth. Her mom was a driving force in creativity and intellectualism through art and literature. This came as a rejection of her mother’s childhood – her mother never felt anchored, which is why reading was so important to her – and that importance was instilled as a value in her children. Sister Mary Anne, Carrasco’s fourth grade teacher, was also formative as far as supporting Carrasco holistically in addition to her passion for art. Carrasco remembers Sister Mary Anne giving the Carrasco family milk in summer school, which was especially influential because Carrasco recalls being poor from a young age. Her father passed away when Carrasco was 12 years old. She was the one to witness his death and had to call 911 to get emergency medical care. This made her feel accountable for carrying on his legacy and wishes. She became interested in college thanks to her father and the Upward Bound program at UCLA (Upward Bound provided college preparatory classes over the summer for her and her sister). The instructors and counselors in the program had a profound effect on her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In high school, Carrasco was not active in M.E.Ch.A. (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán). She instead focused on art and journalism. She was an editor of The Oarsman, the Venice High School newspaper, and then become the first female editor of La Gente, the Chicano newspaper at UCLA. While Carrasco was admitted into UCLA, she did not get into the art school. She went to the Dean of the Art School with the dismal numbers on their diversity, arguing that institutionalized racism was to blame for her rejection. She was subsequently admitted to the program. This experience helped Carrasco realize that the word “no” can be turned around if you’re determined enough. She relates this inherent willingness to lead the fight for justice to the fact that Saint Joan of Arc is her patron saint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In college, Carrasco supported herself through part-time jobs like portraits and commissions for Universal Studios. She continued to develop a variety of artistic techniques, including ballpoint pen and silverpoint, and eventually, in the 1980s, was commissioned to do her very first mural, <em>The History of Los Angeles: A Mexican Perspective, </em>which turned out to be very controversial. The mural was extremely critical of events in American history, such as Japanese internment, which resulted in only parts of the mural ever being displayed at a single point in time. In 1991, Carrasco received her MFA, but wasn’t inspired enough to continue making art, especially with the death of Cesar Chavez in 1993, for whom she created a funeral banner. In 1993, she married Harry Gamboa, Jr., with whom she had been professionally and personally involved for many years. Her daughter, Barbie, was born in 1994 and Carrasco was diagnosed with lymphoma in the following year. She received a bone marrow transplant in 1996 to treat the disease, but found that her hand was never again steady enough to do detailed work. Carrasco has also been active in other areas, such as academia. Carrasco was a UC regent’s professor in 2002-2003 and was a founding member of the Dolores Huerta Foundation, currently serving on the board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carrasco focuses on women in her art, which has always been politically oriented. A recent example of this political orientation is her Dolores Huerta piece on the labor and civil rights activist. All of her art has been subject to censorship, not just her aforementioned controversial mural. More recently, she has participated in art collectives like the Galería de la Raza website. And in 2014, Carrasco was recognized as a Los Angeles “Community Champion.”</p>",mujeres,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/BC_0.PNG,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/BC_0.PNG,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/square_thumbnail/public/BC_0.PNG,https://chicanapormiraza.org/chicanas/barbara-carrasco

Her father was a first generation Mexican-American whose family migrated to the United States from Chihuahua, Mexico, and her mother was a Tongva Native American. In the 1950s and 1960s, El Monte experienced extreme racial tension, and Arellanes witnessed race riots throughout her high school years. She attended college briefly before choosing to drop out, pursuing travel and more life experience. At this young age, she began interacting with a group that would later proclaim themselves the Brown Berets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first she was unsure about joining the radical group, but Arellanes became deeply involved and eventually became the only woman to hold a major leadership position within the organization. As the Minister of Finance and Correspondence for the founding chapter, Arellanes wrote press releases, penned letters, and edited the group’s newspaper, <em>La Causa</em>. Like the Black Panthers, the Brown Berets were considered an extreme, paramilitary group by law enforcement, but their objectives revolved around community betterment and social change. They worked to achieve better education for Chicano youth, gain adequate health services in their communities, end police brutality against minorities, and promote cultural pride. The Brown Berets created El Barrio Free Clinic, and Arellanes was given the task of managing its day-to-day operations. Although she was initially apprehensive about taking the job, El Barrio Free Clinic soon became her passion. Public health facilities and the local hospital knew that she could reach the people they could not. The hospital sent her supplies and picked up lab work from the free clinic regularly. Young people were more comfortable at the clinic, while others were not worried about their legal status affecting their treatment there. Arellanes took pride in the positive impact the clinic had on community members and was thrilled when it sparked interest in the medical field for people who had not considered such careers before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During her time with the Brown Berets, Arellanes attended many major Chicano movement events, including the Poor People’s Campaign in Washington, DC, the blowouts, or high school walkouts in Los Angeles, and both Denver Youth Conferences. Arellanes even rented a truck to shuttle high school students to the Denver Youth Conference with her. In the early 1970s, after years of mistreatment and sexism, all female members separated from the Brown Berets. After her departure from the Brown Berets, Arellanes organized Las Adelitas de Aztlán, a women’s group, and started another free clinic, La Clinica del Barrio. Her involvement in the Chicano Moratorium, a large anti-Vietnam War and civil rights demonstration, cannot go unnoted either. Arellanes was on stage when the violence broke out. She was tear gassed, and although she recovered physically, she was emotionally scarred for many years by what she witnessed that day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the movement years, Arellanes has reconnected with her Native American heritage and is now an elder of the Tongva tribe. She served as a secretary on the Tribal Council and is part of an Indigenous Grandmothers group. She raised two sons as a single mother and now has a grandson.</p>",mujeres,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/Screen%20Shot%202015-11-02%20at%2011.12.29%20AM.png,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Screen%20Shot%202015-11-02%20at%2011.12.29%20AM.png,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/square_thumbnail/public/Screen%20Shot%202015-11-02%20at%2011.12.29%20AM.png,https://chicanapormiraza.org/chicanas/gloria-arellanes

She was the second oldest of seven children, and she shared an intense bond with her mother. After 15 years of marriage, Escalante’s mother decided to divorce her father due to his infidelity, alcoholism and abuse. At the divorce court proceedings, her father was granted custody of all seven children, because of &nbsp;her mother’s lack of employment and housing. After the divorce, Escalante’s mother moved to Los Angeles to live with her sister and find work in hopes that she might be able to regain custody of her children. Devastated to be separated from her mother, and miserable with “the oppressive situation” of living with her father’s extended family (who frequently blamed her mother for the divorce), Alicia Escalante vowed to be reunited with her mother at any cost., At the age of nine, Escalante jumped into an open freight car of the train that ran behind her house. She was determined to make it to California by any means necessary.After the police discovered her, her father allowed her to continue on her journey to California, where her legacy would begin.</p>
<p>As Alicia entered adulthood and began to forge a life for herself, it became very clear that there were many inequalities that surrounded her. &nbsp;A single mother of five, she was swallowed by poverty and thus began to recognize the Welfare system as punitive and oppressive. Alicia felt that the women forced to seek services were never treated with any dignity or respect. This would drive her to become involved with the Chicano Movement and eventually to create the East LA Welfare Rights Organization in 1967. &nbsp;She was able to get the organization started with the assistance of her family practitioner, Doctor Carlo. He set her up with an office and phone where she was able to begin mobilizing the community on welfare rights issues surrounding medical and services cuts. &nbsp;Alicia was concerned about the mistreatment of women, specifically Blacks and Latinas, who found themselves on welfare “through no fault of their own.”</p>
<p>As part of the Welfare Rights Movement and Chicano Movement she became very close with leaders like Corky Gonzalez and Gloria Arellanes. After political and legal persecution as a result of her activism, Escalante spent some time in Denver teaching Spanish and Welfare rights at Corky Gonzales’ Escuela Tlatelolco. She was also involved with protesting police brutality, the Vietnam War and researching world hunger.</p>
<p>Escalante’s Chicana Welfare Rights Organization provided community workshops on welfare policies and rights, translated welfare forms for Spanish speaking families, aided people in applying for aid and grievances, and even opened a café to help feed the community while training welfare women for work. She also worked to create a bilingual newspaper through her organization, La Causa De Los Pobres. Alicia began to realize her writing could be used to mobilize and empower people to enact change. Although her newspaper was short lived, she wrote many articles for various news outlets including Encuentro Femenil and La Raza Newspaper.</p>
<p>Alicia worked to transform Welfare policies on a state and national level, even participating in the Poor People’s Campaign march on Washington. She was also involved in policy change around the sterilization of women of color and in shaping early Chicana feminist thought during the Chicana Movement. &nbsp;After moving to Sacramento California, Alicia continued to advocate for underrepresented women and youth as a Social Worker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In her all-female high school, Cardona pursued the academic track and, while she was successful academically, she was also frustrated by the fact that the arts were treated as “extracurricular.” In spite of her great high school experience, Cardona realized there were many different walks of life outside of the Bronx. In college, Cardona commuted to classes at Marymount Manhattan College, extending the time in what she calls her “gilded cage.” During her first trip abroad, to study in Spain during the Francisco Franco regime, Cardona joined a politically motivated theatre group, which was her first taste of activism and initiated her political awakening. Following her trip abroad, and her graduation with a BA in Studio Art and Art History from Marymount Manhattan College, Cardona left New York for the University of Michigan, where she pursued graduate studies in Art History.</p>
<p>At Michigan, Cardona soon found the Chicano Advocates Office and met activists Jesse Gonzalez and Julio Perazza. Together, they began the Raza Art and Media Collective. Through the Raza Art and Media Collective, Cardona recruited many Californian Chicanos, Tejanos, New Mexicans, and Puerto Ricans. Cardona enjoyed working with Chicano artists and the vibrant Chicano art scene, and eventually she became more engaged by the art she was learning about outside of her Master’s program than she was with the more traditional art history she was learning in her classes. Nevertheless, she still managed to earn Master’s degrees in History of Art and Instructional Technology from the University of Michigan. After completing her course of study, Cardona traveled to Puerto Rico with Julio Perazza to photograph subjects and record oral histories for a project called “Los Viejitos.” Cardona was also essential in the activities of Casa de Unidad in Detroit in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>In 1977, Cardona received a fellowship to work at the National Endowment for the Arts in D.C where she provided administrative support to the Hispanic task force. While in Washington, Cardona became pregnant with her son, Simón, and her partner, Julio Perazza, moved from Michigan to D.C. to work at the Library of Congress. Cardona returned to Puerto Rico in 1980 for a trip with her family and conducted an oral history of Jack Delano, who was the head of the Division of Community Education in the 1950s. When she returned to Michigan, she found a position in the College of Education’s Office of Minority Affairs at the University of Michigan and Jack Delano continued to be a solid artist-mentor for Cardona. Eventually, Cardona took a position at the Michigan Department of Education, where she worked from 1987 to 2011. She is a longstanding activist for equity and art in education and has devoted 23 years in multiple leadership positions. She continues to provide leadership in arts education at the state and national levels.</p>",mujeres,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/Screen%20Shot%202015-12-08%20at%203.04.37%20PM.png,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Screen%20Shot%202015-12-08%20at%203.04.37%20PM.png,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/square_thumbnail/public/Screen%20Shot%202015-12-08%20at%203.04.37%20PM.png,https://chicanapormiraza.org/chicanas/ana-luisa-cardona

Born in 1948, Gonzales was the second oldest of eleven children raised in a strict Catholic family in south Texas. From an early age, her family dynamics made her aware of gender disparities and how her identity as a woman changed the way she moved in the world. This realization propelled Gonzales to become interested in women’s issues such as the concept of autonomy and rape culture.</p>
<p>Gonzales moved to Michigan in her twenties to help look after two of her siblings who were attending college at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Prior to moving to Michigan permanently, Juana and a few of her siblings lived in different parts of Michigan and Wisconsin working as migrant workers. In Kalamazoo, Juana became involved with many groups, serving as a member of a Chicano Advisory Board to Kalamazoo Public Schools and working at Kalamazoo Planned Parenthood and Kalamazoo Daycare Center. She also recalls organizing an informal group of Chicanas who met frequently to discuss the gendered contradictions they faced within the Chicano movement. It was in Western Michigan that she met her husband, Jesse Gonzales, who was part of a rising student leadership movement.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">After her husband was admitted to a Master's Program at the University of Texas, they moved to Ann Arbor, where they joined a growing group of Latino activists (among them Julio Perazza and Ana Cardona) participating in a number of cultural and political organizations and activities, including the production of a recruitment film aimed at Latina/os. Gonzales attended the University of Michigan briefly and then finished her degree at Michigan State University, where she received a Bachelor of Arts in Family and Child Science. Gonzales participated in several student groups during her time at both universities, including the Chicano Student Movement Group, the Women’s Advisory Committee, Chicano Students for Progressive Action, Trabajadores Por La Raza, and Mujeres Unidas de Michigan. She was also active in the Chicano student movement at MSU, and served on several campus-wide committees including the MSU Presidential Search Committee in 1978 (M. Cecil Mackey).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In 1979, Gonzales began teaching early elementary students at Red Cedar School in East Lansing, Michigan. While teaching, Gonzales provided educational opportunities to migrant children, served as a migrant daycare teacher, and taught in the migrant program at Lansing Community College. She was awarded a Crystal Apple Award in 2003 from the College of Education at Michigan State University honoring her service to education and her commitment to teaching. Currently, Gonzales is retired and living in East Lansing, Michigan with her husband, Jesse Gonzales.</p>

I was raising four children as a single parent in the community when I was going to funerals for kids every other week...every other week.","Angela Reyes was born on October 2,1954 and has lived and served in the community of Southwest Detroit ever since. Throughout her time from elementary to high school, Angela recounts coming face-to-face with prejudicial attitudes from classmates and teachers, experiences that forever marked her own developing, personal identity as a Mexican woman with indigenous roots.",,"<p>Angela Reyes was born on October 2,1954 and has lived and served in the community of Southwest Detroit ever since. Throughout her time from elementary to high school, Angela recounts coming face-to-face with prejudicial attitudes from classmates and teachers, experiences that forever marked her own developing, personal identity as a Mexican woman with indigenous roots.</p>
<p>With a natural inclination towards community building and healing, Angela initially began formalizing her multifaceted approach to community care through the Chicano Boricua Studies (CBS) program at Wayne State University. As a member of the pioneering class of CBS, Reyes attributes her time in the program and the tandem student group, El Colectivo, as the space that taught her that the insight of her ideas—ideas of racial justice and community equity—were not only valid, but also potentially transformative.</p>
<p>Angela drew on her deep rooted sense of belonging to Southwest Detroit as well as a big picture view of community relations in her work with at-risk Latinx populations through Latino Outreach, a non-profit agency now known as Latino Family Services (LFS) in the 1970s. After over a decade of work at LFS, Angela, built on her experience with the nuances of non-profit work in Southwest Detroit to found the Detroit Hispanic Development Cooperation (DHDC) in 1998.</p>
<p>While its early years were humble, the DHDC has evolved from a small collective of people working out Angela’s living room to a historic, award winning resource center whose mission has remained centered around the lived experiences of at-risk Latinx youth.</p>
<p>Today, DHDC is still directed by the tireless and brilliant efforts of Reyes and her family. Angela’s now adult children, along with other “graduates” of DHDC services, remain faithful to the work of the organization and have carved out roles for themselves working alongside Angela’s direction to continue their mission—a truly inspiring “full circle” of community justice and accountability. Since its inception, Angela Reyes and DHDC have continued to expand their resources for Latinxs across Southwest Detroit; DHDC offers after school and summer programs for the youth, English as a Second Language courses, GED Classes, HIV and AIDS prevention and outreach programs, FIRST robotics programs, scholarship opportunities, housing counseling, parenting classes, tattoo removal services, community organizing liaisons, gang retirement programs, and much more.</p>

And to me, that means reflecting a realistic image.","Nancy Alicia De Los Santos Reza was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. Her parents were born in Texas and migrated to the big city after World War II. Nancy’s father, Nicolas, served in the Navy. Her mother, Micaela, was a stay-at-home mother and housewife, raising six children. Their own negative experience with speaking Spanish in Texas schools, led to the decision for their children to speak English only.",,"<p>Nancy Alicia De Los Santos Reza was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. Her parents were born in Texas and migrated to the big city after World War II. Nancy’s father, Nicolas, served in the Navy. Her mother, Micaela, was a stay-at-home mother and housewife, raising six children. Their own negative experience with speaking Spanish in Texas schools, led to the decision for their children to speak English only.</p>
<p>From a young age, Nancy experienced the segregation and racial tension that characterized Chicago in the 1970s. As a young Mexican-American girl, she grew up surrounded by a loving and large Mexican American family; but outside of the family, being “Mexican” was not considered an asset.</p>
<p>Nancy struggled with finding her identity among her black and white peers at the &nbsp;public and parochial schools she attended. She did find a sense of belonging among the Spanish Chantels, a girl gang and social club as a young girl. Later she would discover a similar sense of community with the Pilsen community organization Mujeres Latinas en Acción.</p>
<p>Despite being a bright high school student, no one ever encouraged Nancy to consider attending college. Instead, she–like other young Latina students–was steered to Jones Commercial High School: a secretarial school that provided half day office jobs for seniors in high school and taught them office skills and personal grooming. After graduation Nancy began a secretarial job at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. While there, she met a coworker whose family had sent him from Bogota, Colombia to attend college in Chicago, and it was he who convinced her to attend college. She began studying at Chicago City College, transferred to Northeastern Illinois University, and eventually finished her bachelor’s degree at the University of Texas at Austin. She later completed her Masters in Communications at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.</p>
<p>It was at Northeastern University that Nancy’s interest in Chicano and Chicana activism and identity peaked. She became co-editor with fellow student José Gaspar of the Chicano student newspaper, “Contra la pared.” She also met a few influential professors, sociologists Samuel Betances and Alberto Mata, who shaped her thinking and encouraged her to pursue an independent study on Latinos in television in Los Angeles. During this period, Nancy traveled to the west coast with Gaspar, where they audited classes for a semester at Cal State Northridge and were immersed in this birthplace of Chicano studies, studying with famed Rudy Acuña and Raul Ruiz. By the time she transferred to the University of Texas, Nancy knew she wanted to study media.</p>
<p>During the mid-1970s, Nancy’s involvement with the advocacy group “Mujeres Latinas en Acción” became they very foundation of her social activism. This group changed a lot for Nancy in terms of her identity and clarity as a Latina and a Chicana. In 1975 she attended the International Women’s Year Conference in Mexico City with the group, which gave her a new perspective on her heritage, her gender, and the world. The influence of Mujeres Latinas marked a key step for Nancy on her long journey towards embracing her Mexican heritage and supporting feminist ideology.</p>
<p>After graduating from the University of Texas’s Radio, Television, and Film Department, Nancy completed her Master’s degree in Communications at the University of Michigan, and then moved back to her hometown to work for WTTW11, the public TV channel in Chicago. She worked her way up to become the producer of &nbsp;“At the Movies” with film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel. Nancy is now a successful and well-respected writer, producer, and director. She’s been involved with numerous projects including her own celebrated documentary “The Bronze Screen: 100 Years of the Latino Image in Hollywood Cinema”, a historical look at Latinos in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Nancy continues to write, produce, and direct in L.A., and to live her life mission to create realistic images of Latinos and Latinas in the media.</p>",mujeres,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/1401_0011NDLSR_111014_01401_0011NDLSR_111114_241.jpg,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/1401_0011NDLSR_111014_01401_0011NDLSR_111114_241.jpg,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/square_thumbnail/public/1401_0011NDLSR_111014_01401_0011NDLSR_111114_241.jpg,https://chicanapormiraza.org/chicanas/nancy-alicia-de-los-santos-reza

Blanca spent her childhood in Durango, where she was competitive in sports, danced ballet folkorico and helped her father at his pharmacy.

From him she learned the concept of helping others, as he often helped his clients that couldn’t afford badly needed medications.&nbsp; Blanca also learned British English from a private teacher at Escuela America during her youth.</p>
<p>Following her father’s death in 1962, Blanca’s mother decided to move to Chicago, where her brother Jose Cruz Alba lived while directing the Mariachi Potosino in the Pilsen neighborhood. Blanca first lived with her brothers in Tampico and worked as an executive secretary before following her mother shortly thereafter at the age of 17.&nbsp; In 1964 she became a student at the now closed St. Patrick’s High School for Girls and graduated in the class of 1967 after being advanced twice.&nbsp; During these years Blanca again played sports and found comfort going to church at Precious Blood, near Harrison and Western, which was near her home.&nbsp; There she became involved with the youth leadership program, taught catechism and translated the church’s newsletter into Spanish. &nbsp;She was so involved in the church that Blanca was encouraged to become a nun by many. However, she had visions of helping individuals beyond the church as well.</p>
<p>In 1969, Blancabecame involved with<em> Ayuda</em>, a weekly call-in television program for Latinos in Chicago on Channel 26 that was hosted by Ruth Mojica Hammer.&nbsp;&nbsp; While there, through the mentorship of Mojica Hammer, she began building her networks and connecting with other community members.&nbsp; She became involved in several other organizations, such as People’s Yes, which was involved in employment assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blanca Vargas was inducted to LULAC (League of United Latin American Citizens) in 1969 and remained active within the organization for almost 20 years. LULAC focused on helping individuals learn about and complete the process for citizenship. Blanca also worked with Ser Just for Progress, an organization established by LULAC, which helped high school students gain access to technical programs, job training, and ESL classes. &nbsp;In 1972 Blanca became a United States citizen, which deeply motivated her to find additional ways of helping those around her.&nbsp; That same year, Blanca helped found the first League of United Latin American Citizens Chicago Council, which was dedicated to preparing immigrants to become United States citizens and active voters.&nbsp; From 1973-1978 Blanca worked at the Office of Governor Dan.&nbsp; During this period she became a member of the Fiesta Del Sol planning committee and through her connections with NBC local anchor, Linda Alvarez, the festival was televised for the first time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blanca also co-hosted the call-in radio talk show <em>Las Voces Femininas</em>, on WOJO 1051.&nbsp; The show was hosted by women but served all callers from the community with information about job offerings and services available from federal agencies.&nbsp; In 1976 Blanca once again worked with Ruth Mojica Hammer to create the Mexican American Business and Professional Women’s Club, and eventually served as the organization’s secretary.</p>
<p>The latter part of Blanca’s career was dedicated to job placement, which she describes as her “cup of tea.”&nbsp; In 1978 Blanca began work as an Employment Specialist at Casa Central, a nonprofit social services agency in Humboldt Park dedicated to helping Latino residents locate employment.&nbsp; After several years she moved on to work at the Chicago Urban League (1979-1981) and then the Illinois Department of Human Rights (1981-2012), where she was able to focus her efforts on those from underprivileged communities, primarily African American and Latino.&nbsp; Upon her retirement in February of 2014, Blanca was honored for 35 years of service to the community of Cicero, where she lives.&nbsp; She has also been recognized for the nearly 20 years she served as LULAC National Vice President for the Midwest, National Chaplain, Illinois State Director and President of the Local LULAC Council of Cicero and a member of the Board of Directors for National LULAC Educational Centers.</p>",mujeres,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/blancavargas.jpeg,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/blancavargas.jpeg,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/square_thumbnail/public/blancavargas.jpeg,https://chicanapormiraza.org/chicanas/blanca-vargas

Her family first lived in the Maxwell Street area, a diverse port of entry for many of Chicago’s immigrants.&nbsp; When her family moved to the South Shore neighborhood, however, her community and school were not very diverse and the family faced racism.&nbsp; Facing this discrimination at a very young age fostered her political consciousness and activism. Virginia was particularly inspired by her mother, Suzie, who exposed her to activism and standing up to discrimination first hand.&nbsp; Suzie was one of the first Hispanic precinct captains in the 7th Ward in the early 1950’s and served in the post for over 30 years. Suzie also served her community as one of the founders of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) of Chicago.</p>
<p>Virginia’s own activism began when she was about 14 years old, when she became a member of the Junior LULAC. Despite her young age, she traveled to different states to attend events, with her mother’s support. She graduated from James H. Bowen High School on Chicago’s South Side in 1962.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of Virginia’s first jobs involved working with the department of corrections as a parole agent for the adult division, and later with the junior division. She worked for several years helping ex-offenders and attempting to improve the recidivism rate of prisons. After her time spent in the department of corrections, Virginia began her job in the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) as a contract compliance officer. Her task was to represent the children of different wards in the city and purchase services that would benefit them. While she held this position, Virginia also raised two boys and began her college career at Northeastern University at the age of 27.</p>
<p>In 1980, Virginia and her husband Ernest Ojeda were the first Latinos to open a McDonald’s restaurant in the Chicagoland area.&nbsp; Since then, Virginia has acquired two more McDonald’s locations in the city.</p>
<p>Being engaged in the community is important to Virginia, and particularly encouraging the development of Latina business owners and professionals.&nbsp; She served as the president of the Mexican American Business and Professional Women's organization for several years.&nbsp; She was also the first woman chair at the Mexican American Chamber of Commerce and sits on several boards such as WTTW Chicago, the McDonald’s Hispanic Owners of Chicagoland (former president), and the Ounce of Prevention Fund.</p>
<p>Some of her significant awards include: being named in the 10% of restaurant operators nationwide in 2003; her induction into the Women’s Hall of Fame in Chicago; and being named National Business Woman of the Year by the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.</p>

She lived with her parents and three sisters, who were “the first Mexicans” to own a house in a mostly Jewish and Polish community. Frances grew up going to Catholic school and attended Saint Casimir’s, now known as Our Lady of Tepeyac. She started noticing inequality as young as at eight years old, when the nuns at her school called on and gave more positive attention to the white students than to her. Thus, Frances became aware of racism and inequality from an early age.",,"<p>Frances Sandoval Melendez was born in 1953 in the Trumbull Park area of Chicago, Illinois. She lived with her parents and three sisters, who were “the first Mexicans” to own a house in a mostly Jewish and Polish community. Frances grew up going to Catholic school and attended Saint Casimir’s, now known as Our Lady of Tepeyac. She started noticing inequality as young as at eight years old, when the nuns at her school called on and gave more positive attention to the white students than to her. Thus, Frances became aware of racism and inequality from an early age.</p>
<p>When she was very young, Frances married her first love and together they had a son named Arthur. After the birth of Arthur, Frances returned to school to get her GED. She felt inspired to bring her children a better life and future, so she went on to Luke College.</p>
<p>In 1982, Frances was working at Legal Assistance in downtown Chicago when she received a call from Juan Soliz, the director of the Immigration Project at Legal Assistance. She accepted his invitation to help organize his campaign for state representative and coordinated a petition drive for Soliz’s campaign. After helping Juan Soliz campaign as an independent candidate for Illinois state representative in 1982, Frances became Soliz’s campaign manager. This was when Juan Soliz won against Vito Marzulo and became the first Latino state representative in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1985 Frances worked as Soliz’s campaign manager to help elect him as Alderman in Chicago, and he won. Soliz served one term as Alderman, and Frances was his assistant.</p>
<p>Tragically, Frances’ son Arthur was murdered this same year while attempting to save his friend’s younger sister from being kidnapped by Juan Lopez Rojo and his fellow gang member.</p>
<p>In response to lack of legal or police action regarding her son’s murder, Frances contacted news affairs and held a press conference at her house, publicly offering a reward for any information leading to the arrest of her son’s murder. Following Frances’ media outcry she received numerous emotional phone calls from mothers of victims of gang violence expressing their painful stories. She noticed how many of these victims’ voices were unheard and hadn’t received justice, and how there were absolutely no support groups for mothers and families of victims of gang violence throughout the entire U.S. Thus, Frances was inspired to form Mothers Against Gangs (MAG) as the very first organization of its kind to provide mental, emotional, and legal support for mothers and families of victims of gang violence.</p>
<p>MAG received seed money from President Ronald Reagan’s office to make pamphlets and educational pieces to spread awareness for victims of gang violence about victim assistance programs. They also helped communities become aware of gang activity and recruitment. As it gained more members and publicity, MAG began to form additional chapters nationwide. Throughout the 1980’s, MAG also reached out to children by holding educational assemblies at elementary, middle, and high schools. Offshoots of MAG were formed, such as Parents Against Gangs, Neighbors Against Gangs, and Communities Against Gangs.</p>
<p>During the 1990’s, Frances began her efforts for national legislation to combat gang violence. She did this by focusing on working to change policies and legislations and to work for truth in sentencing.</p>
<p>The continuation of Frances’ work in political and social justice is still seen in her participation in campaigning for Jesus Chuy Garcia for mayor of Chicago in 2015.</p>
<p>She is now retired in Florida.</p>",mujeres,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/default_images/headshot.png,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/default_images/headshot.png,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/square_thumbnail/public/default_images/headshot.png,https://chicanapormiraza.org/chicanas/frances-sandoval-melendez

Our goal was always to immerse ourselves with people.","From her beginnings as a girl who only spoke Spanish in east El Paso, Texas to becoming one of the most influential members of the Las Hermanas organization, Sister Yolanda Tarango is a proud Chicana feminist. She is the oldest of 7 children and started school in an “Anglo” Catholic school where she learned to speak English, but also experienced her first wave of institutionalized racism.",,"<p>From her beginnings as a girl who only spoke Spanish in east El Paso, Texas to becoming one of the most influential members of the Las Hermanas organization, Sister Yolanda Tarango is a proud Chicana feminist. She is the oldest of 7 children and started school in an “Anglo” Catholic school where she learned to speak English, but also experienced her first wave of institutionalized racism. However, as she changed schools in her fourth-grade year due to the unfair gerrymandering that racially separated her Latina community from the church, her family moved her and her siblings to the “Mexican” church school. It was here that she really excelled because of her knowledge of English from her previous schooling experience. She graduated from there to go to a Catholic high school, and just after graduating high school, she joined the convent in 1966 and is still a nun today.</p>
<p>1966 was an important time for Catholicism because it marked the ending of the second meeting of the Vatican and many traditions were changed and let go. She appreciates how she was able to experience this change, even though staying with the convent is not what she had originally planned to do. She remembers telling her parents to come get her after a semester because it was only an experiment before going to college. She decided to stay and then attended college while she was in the convent. While she had a difficult time adjusting to her life at the convent, including being away from family and accepting another name, she made the effort to stay in touch with the Chicana movement. She recalls saving newspaper clippings so she could stay up to date, and would hide them for fear of being caught because at the time, convent women in her same status were supposed to let go of their past.</p>
<p>It was through her experiences in the convent, and her interactions with other Sisters, that she really awakened to the depths of institutionalized racism. She carried these experiences with her as she traveled to Dallas, Texas for her new job working at a center for children with mental health conditions. While there, she was part of the founding of Las Hermanas, which was an organization that was initially established to bring Latinas in the convent together to advocate for their people. The organization sent letters to all the Spanish-speaking Sisters calling them to an organizing meeting in 1971. This was very important to Sister Yolanda Tarango because she discovered that she was not the only one struggling to bring together her identity as a religious Sister and as a Latina. In this group, she was not a minority and there was a lot of support and power with this group of women. She is still a part of this organization, and she describes how the structure of Las Hermanas is one that is ever-changing and has survived because it has the ability to adapt and reform. She maintains that Las Hermanas’ organizational model called for Sisters to be in the trenches with the people who needed their support. This kept their focus on promoting justice for those who had no voice.</p>
<p>Las Hermanas underwent a great deal of change from its beginnings throughout the 1970s, and the organization faced structural issues as well. As Sister Yolanda points out, there were obstacles with families, husbands, and even the Church, as women were breaking out of these traditional roles and advocating for a more equitable experience here in the U.S. She recalls the importance of the organization’s shift from a more myopic woman-in-the-Church based focus, to an adoption of the whole feminist agenda. This broadening empowered more women to join the organization, and it also, in the eyes of Sister Yolanda, allowed Las Hermanas to bring the church to communities that were not being served adequately by the Catholic church. After the shift to a broader agenda, Las Hermanas began to work with other groups. The organization participated directly with the farmworkers movement, and on an individual and local basis, participated in the Chicana movement as well.</p>
<p>Sister Yolanda’s journey as a nun and with Las Hermanas took her various places where she had a role in helping transform the role of women in the church and the Mexican American community. She earned a Master of Divinity Degree and a Doctor of Ministry Degree. She co-authored a book (<em>Hispanic Women: Prophetic Voice in the Church</em>) and published several articles that aim to redefine the roles of women in the church and in society. She states that even though she believes that women could be priests, she felt her calling was to help people, especially women. In 1985, Sister Yolanda and another Sister opened a home for homeless women and their children. She is still living at this home and working with women and children experiencing homelessness. &nbsp;Growing up she recalls her mom’s activism for women, and how that really politicized her and sent her on her journey to become the strong Chicana feminist she is today. She is still active and is considered a role model for many Chicana women, especially to those who are part of the Catholic Church. She believes that women, like men, should be able to have leadership roles in the Church in their everyday lives.</p>

Jimenez Flores was born in Coahuila, Mexico. Her parents, Raul Gomez Jimenez and Elva Flores, decided to immigrate to the United States when Maria was about six years old. Her paternal grandfather, Jaime Jimenez, was the first of her family to migrate to the United States. Maria and her family immigrated into Houston, Texas on May 9, 1957. Maria began to understand social inequality from a young age. With the influence of her maternal grandfather, Ramon Flores Ortega, and her father’s involvement in activism and social movements, Maria became interested in social justice. As she read many books about “La Revolución,” or the Mexican Revolution, Maria decided that social justice was her calling.</p>
<p>Maria’s father strongly encouraged Maria and her siblings to pursue higher education. At the age of thirteen years old, she decided that she was going to study political science in order to fight injustices. In high school, Maria was involved in many different organizations. She was a member of her school’s debate team and was aware of the many biases when participating in debate championships. Maria noticed that on occasion, she would lose or win oratory contests because of her nationality; she and her debate partner would also experience a loss due to gender and this further drove her passion for social change.</p>
<p>Maria and her family began to attend church when she was a teenager. Maria was involved in the Catholic Youth Organization. Her priest was also very involved in the Rio Grande farmworker strike[1]. Maria realized that religion was not for her, and in her last semester in high school, she became an atheist. She strongly believes in the process of humanity and this is what drives the way she approaches community change. After Maria graduated from high school, she decided to attend the University of Houston. She originally wanted to go to the University of Texas but did not have the resources to attend. In her first semester at the University of Houston, she became a member of the Young Democrats and while in the organization, she participated in the first lettuce boycott in Houston. In her second semester of college, Maria left the Young Democrats and she became a member of the Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO). As a result of her activism with MAYO, she was asked to run for vice president of the Student Association. She ran for vice president and eventually became president of the UH student body. She was the first woman and first Chicana to be president of the organization. In 1972, they sponsored one of the first gay rights national conventions and also paid Cesar Chavez to speak at an activist rally.</p>
<p>In 1971, the national Conferencia de Mujeres Por La Raza conference was held in Houston at the YMCA to address Chicana and feminist issues. Maria believed that the conference was not at all inclusive and was only for middle-class white women. She was against the convention and many people did not consider her a feminist because of this. Maria strongly believed that she was a part of community feminism in which feminism was expressed through community work. Maria was twenty-one years old when she was first introduced to the Raza Unida Party (RUP), a third political party created by Chicana/o movement activists to elect Chicana/os to local and state office who would address minority and Chicana/o concerns. In 1974, Maria was heavily involved in the Raza Unida Party in Houston, becoming chair of the RUP convention and also helping to organize it. She eventually ran for Texas State Representative under the Raza Unida Party ticket, but quickly realized that politics was not for her and that she loves community organizing and developing social movements.</p>
<p>Maria identifies herself as a feminist but did not participate much in women’s movements of the time. Maria has always believed that the work to be done was within the community and women’s rights were fought within the general fight for equality. She believes that there are many complex issues that need attention, such as class and racial issues. Maria believes that change still has to be made, although there has been progress. Maria said in her interview that “when you begin to fight for liberation, it becomes a process,” and there are still many things that have to be addressed to achieve full equality in rights and dignity for all human beings.</p>

This was our legitimation. This was our moment to be understood. That to be feminist was not to be vendida.,"Marie “Keta” Miranda was born in Los Angeles, California during a time of— in her words — “urban removal,” not “urban renewal.” Her mother was very involved in church organizing activities, from charities to fiestas. It is through her mother that Keta understood the church to be a place for women where they can “laugh out loud and have a good time with each other.” Her mother was a housewife putting in a lot of labor and love raising eight children, six girls and two boys. Her father worked first as a general laborer, then a postal carrier, and then a tile-setter.",,"<p>Marie “Keta” Miranda was born in Los Angeles, California during a time of— in her words — “urban removal,” not “urban renewal.” Her mother was very involved in church organizing activities, from charities to fiestas. It is through her mother that Keta understood the church to be a place for women where they can “laugh out loud and have a good time with each other.” Her mother was a housewife putting in a lot of labor and love raising eight children, six girls and two boys. Her father worked first as a general laborer, then a postal carrier, and then a tile-setter. Keta’s father was atheist and she grew up being told by her mother to pray for her father’s conversion as the Catholic Church recited a prayer for the conversion of Russia at the end of every mass during the Cold War. To her father’s satisfaction, Keta too became atheist.</p>
<p>According to her father, “Catholic schools produce the best atheists,” so Keta grew up attending Catholic schools. She became very radicalized by the nuns at her Catholic high school, who created a space for discussing politics, such as the ongoing Vietnam War. During one class, while a nun expressed favoring the war, Keta and two other African American girls argued against the Vietnam War and they found solidarity with one another. Those girls later invited her to a Black nationalist rally, which she attended and did not feel excluded from because there were other Chicana/o and Brown Beret members at the rally. Keta became very politically aware and involved, attending conferences that taught her how to organize walkouts. During her time in high school, the 1968 “walkouts” took place, in which thousands of Chicana/o middle- and high school students walked out of their classrooms in protest of poor educational conditions — especially the death of college prep courses and many of the teachers’ racism and lack of training. As a senior, Keta’s school was rumored to be closing down, so the young girls organized a demonstration outside the archdiocese office, arguing that he would not have closed a “white school,” and was only closing their school because it was filled with working-class Mexican Americans.</p>
<p>Keta’s organizing continued into college where she received a scholarship to attend Los Angeles Community College (LACC). She became heavily involved in Chicana/o organizations and Students for Democratic Society (SDS). She was active on campus with her social justice activism and would miss class to attend protests and demonstrations. During a rally for Black studies at Carver middle school, police were called in and beat the students. Keta and other students then worked to shut down LACC for a week in protest of the police assault on children. Keta’s activism made others recognize her as “down for the cause” and she was encouraged to run for chair of the United Mexican American Students (UMAS), especially after Chicana faculty member Anna Nietogomez’s victory at Long Beach State University. However, after hearing rumors that Anna was being harassed and attacked, Keta stepped down from running because she was concerned about her physical safety. However, she still continued her activism and continued bringing the “woman question” to the Chicana/o movement and then later to Chicana/o studies.</p>
<p>A major event for Keta was the national 1971 Houston Conferencia de Mujeres Por La Raza Chicana conference. A walkout happened at the conference because some mujeres understood the conference’s sponsoring organization, the Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA), to have a history of oppressing the Chicana/o community. Some participants also did not understand why they were having separate meetings and conferences from Chicanos and men. They argued that they should be organizing as collective Chicana/os, and not just sitting around and talking. Marie did not know how to respond at the time, but later on, she and others developed a new approach by reaching out to women of color. They approached Asian, African, Puerto Rican, and Native American women. It is the identity of women of color and Third World women that Keta felt would bring unity to the Chicano community.</p>",mujeres,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/Marie%20Keta%20Miranda.jpg,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Marie%20Keta%20Miranda.jpg,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/square_thumbnail/public/Marie%20Keta%20Miranda.jpg,https://chicanapormiraza.org/chicanas/marie-keta-miranda

Growing up, her supportive family created the foundation for the love she has for other people. She comes from a financially stable family; her grandfather was a banker, her father a police officer, and her mother was a saleslady. The work ethic of her mother and father was well-developed. In her oral history interview, Evey discusses her parents’ family roles and collaboration with each other: “both of them working, both of them taking care of the children, daddy cooked, mama cooked, it didn’t matter, when things got done, they got done; didn’t matter who did it.” This work ethic emanating from her family helped build Olivia’s own determination to get to work.</p>
<p>The importance of education and learning was also stressed in her family. Evey’s mother made sure that her daughter went to a school on the figurative “right side of the tracks,” instead of her neighborhood school. This was because her mother did not want her daughter to have a Spanish accent, and it was obvious that the better-funded and higher-quality schools were in the Anglo neighborhoods. Evey loved learning and excelled in school all the way through her doctorate degree. This was a self-defining moment as she defied the statistics: the dropout rate for Mexican Americans was at sixty percent. Her passion for education continued to grow as she graduated from the University of Texas with honors, and she would later go on to receive masters and doctorate degrees as well.</p>
<p>She began her career in education working at the Southwest Education Laboratory as a writer and editor. She met Angie Moreno, who helped spark defiance in Evey as she learned about how farmworkers were being treated, leading her to help organize boycotts and marches. She then became involved with the Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO), and especially the Raza Unida Party, a third political party created by Chicana/o movement activists to elect local and state representatives who would address minority concerns. She became chairperson of Raza Unida Party and worked to elect Ramsey Muñiz and Alma Canales as Governor and Lieutenant Governor through the Raza Unida Party. One of her priorities was to spread awareness of Chicana/o struggles through the process of political awareness.</p>
<p>She often tells people, “my mom had two girls; my sister had two girls, and I have two girls.” Understandably, she became known as a feminist because of her strong stand on Chicana rights, but she was not exclusively focused on this issue. While attending a Chicana conference, she believed that the women at the 1971 national Conferencia de Mujeres Por La Raza in Houston were trying to divide men and women by focusing on women’s rights. Refusing to divide the basic support for the family, she worked with MAYO, the Raza Unida Party, and any other place she could advocate for Chicana’s rights without excluding the family. Wherever there was work to be done for the Chicana movement, she was there. Evey believes in the importance of family and that the woman upholds the family. She believes in focusing on education, economy, and other issues that affect Chicanas and the family.</p>
<p>Today, she continues to work successfully in the classroom helping educate people and empowering students from many different backgrounds. She believes that education is power, and she wants students to make the most of their innate skills and the knowledge she provides. Doctora Chapa, as her students call her, stands for the rights of people telling her students often, “I am on your side.”</p>",mujeres,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/olivia%20evey%20chapa.jpg,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/olivia%20evey%20chapa.jpg,https://chicanapormiraza.org/sites/default/files/styles/square_thumbnail/public/olivia%20evey%20chapa.jpg,https://chicanapormiraza.org/chicanas/olivia-evey-chapa

Her parents were very political, and her mother was a curandera and midwife for the community. Her first experiences with racism took place at school: all the Mexican American children were segregated to one room and taught by only one teacher. The students were punished for speaking Spanish and there were separate swings for the Mexican American and Anglo children. But Enriqueta found her activist voice at a young age. In the fourth grade, she recalls speaking up during a history lesson on the U.S. Southwest: “I remember I raised my hand right away [and said], ‘My mother said that they stole all that land from Mexico!’”</p>
<p>After her high school graduation, Enriqueta moved to Denver, where she met famous Chicana/o movement activist Corky Gonzales. She attended night school and went on to work with the U.S. attorney’s office in the 1950s as the only and first Mexican American in the Justice Department. There, she made a point to assign sympathetic and fair judges to the Chicana/os that would go on trial. During this time, she also met her first husband and had two children, but her husband became violent towards her. In 1960, when her now ex-husband attacked her at home, she quit her job and left with her two children to start her life over in California.</p>
<p>A few years later, Enriqueta returned to Denver and began organizing with the GI Forum. She also became assistant director of SER (Service, Employment, and Redevelopment), an organization that helped Chicana/os get jobs and defend their workers’ rights. Always politically active, Enriqueta also helped Corky Gonzales run for mayor of Denver. During this time, she was one of only two women to help picket the Rocky Mountain News newspaper for running a racist article against Mexican Americans. Later, she recalls bringing her young nieces with her to learn how to picket. Through her organizing work in Denver, she met her eventual husband Bill Longley — but this time, she would not take her husband’s last name. Enriqueta kept her maiden name, Vasquez, and both she and Bill began signing their name “Longeaux y Vasquez.”</p>
<p>In 1966, at Corky Gonzales’ request, she and Bill moved to San Cristobal, New Mexico to help run the Vincent Ranch. The Vincent Ranch was an extension of the Denver-based Escuela Tlateloco, and Chicana/o children from the inner-city were taught wilderness survival skills and farm work there. During this time, Enriqueta founded and started publishing the landmark movement newspaper El Grito del Norte with Betita Martinez and a team of local activists. Enriqueta became especially well-known for her column, “Despierten! Hermanos” [Wake Up! Brothers]. The newspaper covered many subjects, including what was happening in the Chicana/o movement — Reies Lopez Tijerina’s land grant movement and Corky Gonzales’ organizing in Denver, especially — as well as articles in solidarity with U.S.-based, international, and Third Worldist movements.</p>
<p>However, El Grito del Norte and Vincent Ranch attracted the attention of local and federal law enforcement, who claimed that the activists training guerillas at the ranch. Enriqueta recalls being tailed by police the whole 60 miles between San Cristóbal and Española, where they would publish the paper. Further, Vincent Ranch’s library was burned down in 1969. Enriqueta recalls how she and her friends distanced themselves from their families out of fear for their safety — especially when the far-right organization the John Birch Society leaked everyone’s names, phone numbers, car makes and models, license plate numbers, “Everything. We knew we were being watched all the time. But it’s just one of those things, figure, what can we do?”</p>
<p>Enriqueta’s journalism work also took her all over the U.S. and the world, including Cuba and China. In 1969, the Cuban government invited Enriqueta and other journalists from around the world to report on the Cuban revolution’s ten-year anniversary. She was amazed at the racial desegregation taking place in Cuba, where black musicians and white musicians played on the same stage together. It was then she realized how “brainwashed” U.S. Americans were about race. She also became a strong advocate of Cuba and of socialism, which she felt provided food, education, and livelihood and reduced inequality.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, she went back to school at the University of New Mexico, but was advised against pursuing a master’s. Sensing racial bias behind that advice, Enriqueta says, “That’s why we need Chicana/o clubs, to encourage people to keep going on.” Despite her enormous organizing experience and historical knowledge, including the compilation of several books on Chicana women and La Raza, she never taught a college class. However, she has continued to be an active community member, organizer, and artist. Enriqueta cofounded the organization Hembras de Colores to celebrate Cinco de Mayo and put on cultural art shows and high school poetry contests. She has also continued her career as an accomplished writer and painter, and has created beautiful murals in El Prado, Albuquerque, and her own home, including one titled El Puño de Tierra.</p>
<p>Throughout her life, Enriqueta has also explored her indigenous roots as a Chicana. Asked how she understands her relationship to indigeneity, she says, “We’re Chicanos, we are mestizos. We do have indigenous roots… We’re not pure European. Somos mestizos.” Her journey began by attending sun dances and listening to American Indian activist speakers such as Black Elk and Crow Dog. Over time, she grew into a role as a community grandmother and elder. In retrospect, Enriqueta understands that her mother was the first person to teach her indigenous medicine and knowledge through her experience as a curandera and midwife.</p>
<p>Enriqueta’s advice for readers today is to keep up with what’s going on and get involved locally in your own community. She asks us to do whatever you can do, to express yourself creatively, and ultimately, to “Just keep going.”</p>

She lived with her mother, father, and younger brother until she was seven. Cervántez remembers that at a very young age, she became aware that things were different for people of color. Fortunately, her parents provided Cervántez with a strong support system that helped her articulate the confusion and alienation she felt growing up in a racist environment. She grew up watching them support the development of the Civil Rights Movement, empathizing with the African American community in their town. Her parents instilled a sense of social justice that would later become central in her art.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Kansas, Cervántez experienced first hand the after-effects of the landmark case<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education""> Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</a>. Due to changes in school zoning, she attended three different schools in Kansas. She recalled being one of the few students of color, in one school. Despite the ruling against segregation in schools, Cervántez stated that the mentality of most had not changed, and racism remained prevalent in her childhood hometown. She recalls being chased home from school every day. In one particular instance, a childhood friend turned to her and said, “No Mexicans Allowed,” asking for her to leave.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once Cervántez turned seven, she and her family moved to California, first to Santa Anna, then Escondido and finally settling in Mount Palomar, where her father worked as a laborer at a turkey ranch from 1963 to 1968. Cervántez’s family moved into a small one-bedroom trailer, which later was remodeled to include two makeshift wooden rooms. In her time in Mount Palomar, she interacted with a diverse group of students in school, which included Native American children, Mexican immigrants, and White children. Cervántez viewed school as a place of possibility, but it was also a place of institutional racism where she felt not enough attention was devoted to students of color. In her first two years of high school at Fallbrook, Cervántez received no guidance from her counselor and encountered the same stratification she experienced in her elementary and middle school years. She remembers having to take an hour and a half long bus ride every morning to get to school. Due to the poor living conditions they endured in the small trailer and other personal reasons, the family chose to relocate to Orange County during Cervántez’s sophomore year of high school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon arrival to Orange County, Cervantez attended Westminster High School in Westminster, California, which is where she became politicized. In her junior year of high school, she, along with a group of students started the school’s first United Mexican American Students (U.M.A.S.), later renamed Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztlán (MEChA), with the help of the school librarian. Cervántez became an officer along with her high school friend Gloria Cuevas. Both convinced their sponsor to take them to the National Chicano Moratorium Committee in March 1970 as part of a school field trip. When Cervántez arrived at the march, she remembers feeling amazed at “seeing so many brown people at one place.” She had the opportunity to listen to the speeches from a number of Chicano and Chicana activists, including Rosalio Muñoz before the Los Angeles Police Department became involved. Cervántez was one of the first to witness the first wave of police officers begin to forcefully subdue the crowd. She evaded arrest and avoided being tear-gassed by running away from the commotion. Cervántez recalls being impacted by the violence her community faced at the hands of the L.A.P.D. Cervántez was politicized by the event in her transition from Westminster to the University of California Santa Cruz, where she met others like her who attended the march.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1970, Cervántez started attending the University of California Santa Cruz as an art student. She received financial support through a four-year California Opportunity Grant. She became immersed in the Civil Rights Movement and became a member of the university’s first Third World Coalition. Further politicized by her involvement in the group, she attempted to grapple with political themes in her art. She incorporated text in her work to bring attention to issues that were important to her, such as the treatment of undocumented Central American immigrants. However, professors disapproved of her use of text, claiming that it transformed her art into propaganda, but their comments did not deter her from bringing up political issues in her art. Later, when she encountered the work of Käthe Kollwitz, she became inspired to create self-portraits. Cervántez felt hesitation at first because she questioned whether her self-portraits were relevant to the movement. Despite her hesitation, she continued to generate self-portraits. In the process of creating self-portraits, she began to make sense of the second-wave feminism phrase, “the personal is political.” She realized that through self-portrait, she could expand the representation of brown women in art. Since then, Cervántez has made sense of her agency by continuing to create women-centered art.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cervántez graduated from the University of California Santa Cruz in 1975. She later became the artist in residence at El Centro de La Raza in Long Beach, California, where she helped women with no resources through the program La Nueva Chicana: Homegirl Productions, while continuing to work on her art. After gaining recognition for her piece ""Homenaje a Frida Kahlo"" in 1978, she became the artist in residence at <a href=""https://www.selfhelpgraphics.com/"">Self-Help Graphics</a>. In her time with Self-Help Graphics, she saw the beginnings of their Atelier Program. She also worked alongside Gloria Alvarez, Frances Salomé España, Marialice Jacob, Norma Alicia Pino, and Kay Torres in creating ¡Alerta!, a multi-media installation piece that addressed the topics of immigration, the undocumented and Central American refugees. In support of those affected by the Central Americans Crisis, Cervántez became a part of a Chicano Delegation, put together by the University of California, Los Angeles, and traveled to Managua, Nicaragua. In Managua, intending to build a bridge between two groups, she helped create a mural that merged the Chicano Movement with the Nicaraguan Revolution. After a summer in Nicaragua, Cervántez decided to pursue a Master's in Fine Art.</p>
<p>In 1968, after being rejected and later waitlisted, Cervántez was finally accepted to a graduate program at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as a print-making student. Cervántez first discovered print-making in her time at the University of California Santa Cruz and honed her skills through her work in the community. In her oral history, Cervántez recalls feeling depressed from the lack of representation in her department at UCLA. Many of her professors misunderstood her work, failing to provide Cervántez with the proper support for artistic growth. As an artist working within the community, she had gained hands-on experience and empowerment, but going to UCLA, made her feel invalidated. Cervántez felt the constant need to justify her work. For her Master’s thesis, she proposed the creation of a mural to her committee. Despite their initial reluctance, Cervántez was able to receive funding from SPARC’s Neighborhood Pride Mural Program to complete her mural in 1989. She created “La Ofrenda” as a dedication to the common struggles of Latinx communities. In the mural, she depicted the transformative change of women by using an image of Dolores Huerta as her focus. She incorporated text in her mural using a couple stanzas of Gloria Enedina Alvarez’s poem “Vende Futuro” and the entire poem “Mujer” by Sara Martinez, also known as Rosanna Perez. In addition to working with these two poets, she also worked with Chicana/o and Central American youth assistants and several local graffiti artists. Cervántez prided herself on the diversity of her crew. Upon the completion of the mural, she received her Master’s in Fine Arts in 1989.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After receiving her Master’s, Cervántez struggled to find a full-time position. For over ten years, she consistently held multiple positions; workshop facilitator throughout Los Angeles museums, an educator at UC Irvine, and UC Berkeley. Finally, in 2003 Cervántez received a call from California State University, Northridge’s (CSUN) Department of Chicano Studies, offering her a full-time professor position. Becoming faculty at CSUN provided Cervántez and her family financial stability. Currently, she is still teaching at CSUN and continues to support the next generation of Chicana/o artists.</p>
